To get things to work, first add the following to your .bashrc file:

if [ "$PS1" != "" ] ; then
  PS1="[\u@\h \w]"'\[\033k\033\\\]\$  '
fi

## show Detached screens when you launch screen
if [ -e /usr/bin/screen ]; then
  if [ "$TERM" = "screen" -a ! "$SHOWED_SCREEN_MESSAGE" = "true" ]; then
    detached_screens=`/usr/bin/screen -list | grep Detached`
    if [ ! -z "$detached_screens" ]; then
      echo "+---------------------------------------+"
      echo "| Detached screens are available:       |"
      echo "$detached_screens"
      echo "+---------------------------------------+"
    else
      echo "[ screen is activated ]"
    fi
    export SHOWED_SCREEN_MESSAGE="true"
  fi
fi


After that is done make sure that .sreen* is located in your home directory.  Under the .screen directory, you can place all the profiles you care about.
